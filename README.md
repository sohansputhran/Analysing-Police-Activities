# Analysing-Police-Activities
Analysing the police activities by using the datasets from the Stanford Open Policing Project (https://openpolicing.stanford.edu) which contains the data of all the traffic stops made by the law enforcement agencies in United States of America. In this project, I have considered the dataset of the illinois state for analysing.
